PENDING:
	List-Specific ModelContainer:
		☐ Create LIST Container functionality with ModelContainer
			☐ Do basically the same thing as a Compound, but prevent incongruent Types at the child level
			☐ Update all children Type if parent LIST type changes, rather than deleting or preventing a change (parent can force Type updates)
		☐ Add "Add List" button to Container


BUGS/ISSUES:
	Utility.Transformer:
		☐ .FromJSON() appears to be broken.  Try with a Composition and see if that works.  You'll need to convert the text in the Type field back into a number first.
		☐ .ToComposition() overwrites the Tag directly, which is bad.
			☐ .FromComposition() needs to be checked, after above is fixed


COMPLETED:
	Model Helper Classes:
		✔ Build a ModelComponent Helper class and refactor ModelComponent to do Tag manipulation through the Helper, instead of raw @done(18-10-31 18:12)
		✔ Build a ModelContainer Helper class and refactor ModelContainer to do Tag manipulation through the Helper, instead of raw @done(18-10-31 18:12)
		✔ Build a Model Helper class and refactor Model to do Tag manipulation through the Helper, instead of raw @done(18-10-31 18:11)
