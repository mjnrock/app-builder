PENDING:
	Mutator:
		☐ Create "BuildFromRecord()" that will create a Mutator instance from that Record Tag
		GenerateMutator:
			Refactor outputs like "this.Tag.GetTag("aa").GetTag("aac").GetTag("aaca").SetValues(input);" 
			☐ MakeGetter and MakeSetter don't have a "tier" awareness; they currently just use "this.Tag", even if they are deeply nested
			@NOTE: Iterate over hierarchy..Tag.GetKey() and check for collisions.  If NO, continue, if YES, reformat deeper tiers to prepend as many parent names as necessary to make unique
			☐ MakeGetter and MakeSetter are currently victim to Tag > Key collisions when naming the Getter and the Setter
		@NOTE: Maybe use a result of .ToHierarchy(), iterate over tags, and compare Keys, too--must be able to account for variable length Tags when working with List/Compound
		☐ Create a "Compare()" and "CompareFromRecord()" function that let's you know if the Tag is a Mutator-compliant Tag structure
	RegEx:
		☐ Make RegEx Modal where user can search patterns
			☐ Copy to clipboard option
			☐ Send to RegEx Match/Replace input fields in Model Builder option
	List-Specific ModelContainer:
		☐ Create LIST Container functionality with ModelContainer
			☐ Do basically the same thing as a Compound, but prevent incongruent Types at the child level
			☐ Update all children Type if parent LIST type changes, rather than deleting or preventing a change (parent can force Type updates)
		☐ Add "Add List" button to Container


BUGS/ISSUES:
	Utility.Transformer:
		☐ .FromJSON() appears to be broken.  Try with a Composition and see if that works.  You'll need to convert the text in the Type field back into a number first.
		☐ .ToComposition() overwrites the Tag directly, which is bad.
			☐ .FromComposition() needs to be checked, after above is fixed


COMPLETED:
	Model Helper Classes:
		✔ Build a ModelComponent Helper class and refactor ModelComponent to do Tag manipulation through the Helper, instead of raw @done(18-10-31 18:12)
		✔ Build a ModelContainer Helper class and refactor ModelContainer to do Tag manipulation through the Helper, instead of raw @done(18-10-31 18:12)
		✔ Build a Model Helper class and refactor Model to do Tag manipulation through the Helper, instead of raw @done(18-10-31 18:11)
	ModeContainer:
		✔ Raw Tags are being saved into the Simple Tag as children of a TagCompound, instead of just the Tag @done(18-11-01 18:29)
