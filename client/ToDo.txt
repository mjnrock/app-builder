List-Specific ModelContainer
	[] Create LIST Container functionality with ModelContainer
		[] Do basically the same thing as a Compound, but prevent incongruent Types at the child level
		[] Update all children Type if parent LIST type changes, rather than deleting or preventing a change (parent can force Type updates)
	[] Add "Add List" button to Container



====================================
			BUGS/ISSUES
====================================
Utility.Transformer
	[] .FromJSON() appears to be broken.  Try with a Composition and see if that works.  You'll need to convert the text in the Type field back into a number first.
	[] .ToComposition() overwrites the Tag directly, which is bad.
		[] .FromComposition() needs to be checked, after above is fixed
